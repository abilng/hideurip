Proxy Browser is provided as is, without warranty of any kind. Use of this
service is entirely at your own risk. We cannot take responsibility for any direct 
or indirect damages resulting from the use of this service.

The service allows indirect browsing of external, third-party websites.
We are not responsible for the content on any external websites that may be
accessible through our service. A website viewed through our service is in no way 
owned by or associated with this website.The term "indirect browsing" refers to
the server which you connect to. During "direct" browsing, you connect to the server 
which provides the resource you are requesting. During "indirect" browsing, 
you connect to script running server. Our script downloads the requested resource and
forwards it to you.

Any resource (such as web pages, images, files) downloaded through our service may
be modified. This may include, but is not limited to, editing URLs so that any 
resources referenced by the target resource are also downloaded indirectly. 
The accuracy and reliablity of this process is not guaranteed. The resource which 
you receive may not be an accurate representation of the resource requested.

A side-effect of indirect browsing may be anonymity. By connecting to script
running server instead of the target server, the target server does not see your
IP address. However, we do not guarantee our service will be truly anonymous. 
The downloaded resource may reference other resources which your browser may 
automatically download. The service attempts to reroute all such requests through
script running server but may not be entirely successful. A single direct request 
will compromise your anonymity.

This service may download a resource over a secure connection but this may be 
sent back to you over an unsecure connection. Do not enter confidential 
information unless you are on a secure connection to script running server.
