					<p>The service allows indirect browsing of external, third-party websites. We are not responsible for the content on any external websites that may be accessible through our service. A website viewed through our service is in no way owned by or associated with this website.The term &quot;indirect browsing&quot; refers to the server which you connect to. During &quot;direct&quot; browsing, you connect to the server which provides the resource you are requesting. During &quot;indirect&quot; browsing, you connect to our server. Our script downloads the requested resource and forwards it to you.</p>
<p>Any resource (such as web pages, images, files) downloaded through our service may be modified.

The accuracy and reliablity of this process is not guaranteed. The resource which you receive may not be an accurate representation of the resource requested.</p>
				  <p>A side-effect of indirect browsing may be anonymity. By connecting to our server instead of the target server, the target server does not see your IP address. However, we do not guarantee our service will be truly anonymous. The downloaded resource may reference other resources which your browser may automatically download. The service attempts to reroute all such requests through our server but may not be entirely successful. A single direct request will compromise your anonymity.</p>
